This is mostly just picked up from the awesome work done by https://github.com/amix/vimrc

I just make changes here and there as per my convenience and I will try to document them in this README.

# Changelog

**12th June, 2021:**
* Uploaded the first version of vimrcs that I currently use
* Added coc.vim plugin for autocomplete. The relevant section is there in `plugins_config.vim`
